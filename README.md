# Used-car-price-prediction
Automated prediction of a used carâ€™s price based on its features. Based on the features of the car, the model will predict the base price of the car. Additionally, the system will  identify the damage on the body of the car and if possible, will add the penalty to the base price to give the final  price. The dataset contains 460 images across 4 categories.
